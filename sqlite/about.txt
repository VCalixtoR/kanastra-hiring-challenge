This folder is only to store sqlite local databases.
There is a entry in the gitignore to do not commit things in this folder.

For ORM scenarios, Sqlite is a good database to test things locally before going to dev and production.
    Its lightweight, you do not have permission or connection problems and you can still see their instances in other tools
    using the .db file

    As we are using ORM, the changes will be commited to the dev/prod databases when we use their connections
